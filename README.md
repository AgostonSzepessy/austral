# Austral

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/austral/austral.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/austral/austral)

Not done yet.

Austral is a new language. It is designed to be simple to understand and to
implement.

Features:

- **Linear types**: linear types allow resources to be handled in a
  provably-safe manner. Memory can be managed safely and without runtime
  overhead, avoiding double `free()`, use-after-`free` errors, and double fetch
  errors. Other resources like file or database handles can also be handled
  safely.

- **Capabilities**: linear capabilities enable fine-grained permissioned access
  to low-level facilities. Third-party dependencies can be constrained in what
  types of resources they can access.

- **Typeclasses**: typeclasses, borrowed from Haskell, allow for bounded ad-hoc
  polymorphism.

- **Safe arithmetic**: Austral has well-defined integer modular arithmetic
  semantics, in addition to built-in overflow-checked arithmetic operators and
  saturation arithmetic operators.

- **Algebraic data types**: as in ML or Haskell.

Anti-features:

- No garbage collection.
- No destructors.
- No exceptions (and no surprise control flow).
- No implicit function calls.
- No implicit type conversions.
- No global state.
- No reflection.
- No Java-style @Annotations.
- No type inference, type information flows in one direction.
- No overloading of primitive operators.
- No uninitialized variables.

## Building

Building the `austral` executable requires `make`, [MLton][mlton], and a C
compiler for building the resulting output.

On Debian/Ubuntu, you can install the requisite dependencies with:

```bash
$ sudo apt-get install -y make mlton gcc
```

To build the executable:

```bash
$ make austral
```

To compile in "development mode" (which does not produce an executable binary)
we use [SML/NJ][smlnj], which is faster than MLton and features a REPL. You can
install it in Debian/Ubuntu with:

```bash
$ sudo apt-get install -y smlnj
```

Then, to compile the source code and load up a REPL, run:

```bash
$ make
```

Finally, to run the tests, you need both MLton and SML/NJ. Run this:

```bash
$ ./run-tests.sh
```

## Examples

### Fibonacci

```
function fib(n: i32): i32 =
  if n < 2 then
    n
  else
    fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2)
```

## Practical Linear Types

A simple type system like that of C helps us by pointing out errors concerning
the shape of data: trying to fit a square peg in a round hole. More advanced
type systems help us express the semantic role of data in our types. Linear
types go further, and help us prevent a whole category of defects along the
lines of use-after-`free` and double-`free` errors.

Consider the following database API, using SML notation:

```sml
val connect : string -> database
val query : database -> string -> result list
val close : database -> unit
```

Briefly, the `connect` function takes a connection URI and returns a `database`
instance, the `query` function takes a database instance and a query string and
returns the result list of that query, and `close` closes a database connection.

The correct usage pattern is: we open a database connection, make zero or more
queries, then close it. But SML's type system does not allow us to enforce this.

For instance, we can use the database after it's been closed:

```sml
close db;
val results = query db "SELECT ...";
```

Or we can close the database twice in a row:

```sml
close db;
close db;
```

These errors are similar to use-after-`free` and double-`free` errors in memory
management, respectively. Linear types can help us eliminate this category of
errors entirely.

Consider the same API, but in a slightly different type system where prefixing a
type name with `!` denotes a linear type. Then:

```sml
val connect : string -> !database
val query : !database -> string -> (result list, database)
val close : !database -> unit
```

Now these errors disappear. Use-after-`close` is impossible, because `close`
returns `unit`:

```sml
let val db = connect "my_database"
in
  close db;
  do_something_with db; (* This line is an error because `db` has already been used in the line above *)
end
```

And double-`close` errors are also impossible for the same reason:

```sml
let val db = connect "my_database"
in
  close db;
  close db; (* `db` is used twice *)
end
```

But we can still make multiple queries with the linearly-typed API, because the
`query` function returns a tuple of the result set and the new database
object. In SML notation:

```sml
let val db = connect "my_database"
in
  let val (results, db') = query "INSERT ..." db
  in
    let val (results, db'') = query "SELECT ..." db'
    in
      close db''
    end
  end
end
```

(You can imagine using something like Haskell's `do` notation to remove the
nesting from this example.)
